BrandM3dia KioskOps Offline Portal — QA Report
Version: v4.0-full
Build date: 2025-12-27

What was failing (reported):
- “Document Control” / buttons not navigating or opening resources.
- Multiple local links referenced paths that did not exist in the clean bundle (e.g., SOP/... and Scripts/...).

Root causes found:
1) Missing folders/files that the portal links referenced:
   - The portal HTML referenced SOP/ and Scripts/ folders, but the clean bundle only had docs/ and scripts/.
   - Document Control referenced versioned filenames (v3.2-clean) that were not shipped in the bundle.

Fixes applied in v4.0:
- Added the complete SOP folder from the provided SOP ZIP to /SOP
- Added the complete Scripts folder from the provided Scripts ZIP to /Scripts
- Updated Document Control download links to stable shipped files in /docs:
  - docs/BrandM3dia_Kiosk_Field_Execution_Guide.pdf
  - docs/BrandM3dia_Kiosk_Field_Execution_Guide.docx
  - docs/BrandM3dia_Kiosk_Scenario_Router_OnePager.pdf/.docx and stable alias docs/BrandM3dia_Kiosk_Scenario_Router.pdf
- Added a BOOT DIAGNOSTICS banner that appears if assets/app.js fails to load or JS crashes.
- Added a NAVIGATION FALLBACK that switches sections even if inline onclick is blocked by a browser policy.
- Added an AUTO-EXPORT block that exposes all functions used by inline onclick handlers on window.

Link integrity validation:
- All local href/src references in index.html resolved to existing files in the bundle (0 missing).

How to run (recommended):
- Ubuntu:  python3 tools/serve_portal.py
- Windows: py tools\serve_portal.py
Then open:
- http://localhost:8787/

If something fails in the field:
- Open DevTools Console (F12) and look for 404 errors
- Confirm these load:
  - http://localhost:8787/assets/app.js
  - http://localhost:8787/assets/app.css
